In Visual Studio, developers write code, run tests locally, and commit changes to their feature branches.

3.Pull Requests and Code Reviews

When a feature is complete, the developer pushes their branch to GitHub and creates a pull request.
Other team members review the pull request on GitHub, leaving comments and suggestions.
The original developer addresses the feedback, and once approved, the pull request is merged into the main branch.

4.Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions are configured to run tests and build the project automatically whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
Results of the CI pipeline are visible in GitHub and linked to Visual Studio, ensuring that any issues are promptly addressed.

5.Issue Tracking and Project Management

The team uses GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
Visual Studio's integration with GitHub allows developers to link commits and pull requests to specific issues, providing traceability.

6.Debugging and Deployment

Developers use Visual Studio's debugging tools to identify and fix bugs discovered during testing or reported by users.
Once a feature passes all tests and code reviews, it is deployed to a staging environment, and eventually to production, using GitHub Actions for automated deployment.

Benefits

1.Streamlined Workflow: Developers can perform all essential tasks within Visual Studio, reducing context switching and improving productivity.
2.Collaboration: GitHub's collaborative features, combined with Visual Studio's development tools, enhance team communication and code quality.
